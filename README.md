# Spotify Song Counter  
#### Requires Spotify API developer key  
This is my first project in my programming career, I'm currently in grade 10 and in quarantine. First you must edit the currentSong.py file and paste your API credentials into the specified areas. The first time you run the program, it will prompt you to give access to your spotify account, just follow the instructions shown in the terminal. Run the program only after you have started music playback. Once you run the program, it will run every 10 seconds to check your song progress using the Spotipy library. When you finish listening, Ctrl+C to terminate the program. One last thing to note is that spotify keys expire after an hour, so you must rerun the program after an hour.  
  
To run the program open terminal and navigate to folder. Syntax to run the program is "python3 currentSong.py [Spotify Username]" Put your spotify username where the brackets are, without any brackets.
